# E01a-Control-Structues

Let's start writing some Python code! This is the first set of exercises for MSCH-C220; they should give you the tools to build your first game.

In order to complete the exercise, you will need to do the following:

* Create an account on [github.com](https://github.com).
* Download and install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* Download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

This repository contains several files that you will need to alter to complete the assignment. The instructions for the exercise are on Canvas.

Comments in Python are marked by a # sign (for single-line comments) or three matching quotation marks (''' or """) if a comment requires more than one line. They should also appear in a different color in VS Code. The Python Interpreter ignores comments, so you can safely include any information you want there.

As with your assignments, please edit the LICENSE file (replace the [year] [fullname] with the current year and your name); you will also be expected to edit README.md to describe what you have accomplished.

Edit questions.txt to answer the questions found there.

The first task I accomplished was setting up all of the programs like VSCode and git on my personal computer. After that, I copied my repo to my PC and started on the
actual assignment. I am a senior and a Computer Science major, so I knew most of the questions before testing programs. However, I have not coded in python before, so a little bit is new to me. I went through all of the questions and answered based on what I thought would happen before testing the programs at home. I then went and updated the questions that require telling what happened after running them. If there was something that was new to me, like .format, I would look it up after completing the questions file.
After that, I wanted to do the extra credit so I went through and added comments to each line saying what that line did. I hope I explained them well.
