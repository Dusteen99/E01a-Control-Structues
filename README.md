# E01a-Control-Structues


The first task I accomplished was setting up all of the programs like VSCode and git on my personal computer. After that, I copied my repo to my PC and started on the
actual assignment. I am a senior and a Computer Science major, so I knew most of the questions before testing programs. However, I have not coded in python before, so a little bit is new to me. I went through all of the questions and answered based on what I thought would happen before testing the programs at home. I then went and updated the questions that require telling what happened after running them. If there was something that was new to me, like .format, I would look it up after completing the questions file.
After that, I wanted to do the extra credit so I went through and added comments to each line saying what that line did. I hope I explained them well.
